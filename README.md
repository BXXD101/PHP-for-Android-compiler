# PHP-for-Android-compiler
This script will cross compile the latest PHP to Android for aarch64. Make sure to have git and wget installed in your Linux distro. 

Just run ./compileandroid.sh and all will be done for you. 

After the build is finished you can find the php binary in the dir where you ran the script. 

This PHP wont work with PocketMine-MP since it requires additional libs. I will add that in future.
